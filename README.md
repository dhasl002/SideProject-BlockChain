# SideProject-BlockChain

Inspired by the recent cryptocurrency boom, I wanted to create a dummy currency that anyone could use. This repository is the predecessor to the [P2P Version](https://github.com/dhasl002/SideProject-BlockChain-C-Sharp). This version is the basics of the BlockChain without the aspects of distribution or security.
